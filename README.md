## How do I edit something on the site?

Before you even think of editing anything, check if any branches by the name of `rewrite`, `update` or alike exist.

If you'd like to edit, let's say the `Linux` selfhosting guide, there is a list of requirements you must meet before editing.

- [ ] 1. Is your edit contributing to the site? (Adding pages like "Credits" and adding yourself to it is not )
- [ ] 2. Is your edit a minor? (Grammar fix, rewording, etc.)
- [ ] 3. Is your edit of dire importance? (Site breaking when clicking X and Y)
- [ ] 4. Is your edit going to break the site?
- [ ] 5. Is your edit editing the C# code or just the HTML pages?
- [ ] 6. Are the elements of the page you edited consistent with the rest of the website?
- [ ] 7. Are the elements of the page you edited Bootstrap?
